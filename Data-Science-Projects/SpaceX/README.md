# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

## Introduction
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

The goal of this project is to predict the landing outcome of the Falcon 9 first stage. The methodology follows a complete data science lifecycle, including [data collection](Data-Science-Projects/SpaceX/Data-collection-api.ipynb), [data wrangling](Data-Science-Projects/SpaceX/Data%20wrangling.ipynb), [exploratory data analysis](Data-Science-Projects/SpaceX/EDA%20with%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb), [data visualization](Data-Science-Projects/SpaceX/EDA%20with%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb), [model development](Data-Science-Projects/SpaceX/Machine%20Learning%20Prediction_Part_5.ipynb), and [model evaluation](Data-Science-Projects/SpaceX/Machine%20Learning%20Prediction_Part_5.ipynb).
