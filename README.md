### Hi, I'm Christine üëã  
I'm a psychology major at National Chengchi University (NCCU), with a strong interest in data science, AI, and human-centered technology.  
I focus on applying data-driven methods to real-world human behavior ‚Äî from mental health assessment to behavioral pattern analysis.  
In Fall 2025, I‚Äôll be joining UC Berkeley as an exchange student to further develop my interdisciplinary work at the intersection of psychology and data.

This repository showcases a collection of projects where I explore how data science and AI can support meaningful insights in psychology, and beyond.


## Overview
I divide my projects into four categories:

- [AI + Psychology](#-ai--psychology)
- [Data Science Projects](#-data-science-projects)
- [Group Projects](#-group-projects)
- [Tiny but Fun](#-tiny-but-fun)




## üíó AI + Psychology
Projects combining psychology with data and AI tools.

###  1. Mental Health Assessment Automation System
Developed an automated mental health assessment system and applied machine learning to predict psychological outcomes using data from a longitudinal attachment study. [More](AI-Psychology/Mental%20Health%20Assessment%20Automation%20System)

## üìä Data Science Projects
End-to-end data science projects involving analysis, modeling, and visualization.

###  1. Falcon9 Landing Prediction 
IBM Data Science Capstone project predicting Falcon 9 landings ‚Äî supported by EDA, modeling, and a stakeholder-facing slide deck. [More](Data-Science-Projects/SpaceX)

### 2. Machine Learning Coursework (2025 Spring)
Coursework completed during "Machine Learning : Concepts and Applications" course. Focus on applying Python to real-world datasets, covering topics such as customer segmentation (RFM and clustering), association rule mining, and classification modeling (Decision Tree).
