# â˜• é›¶å£¹å’–å•¡å¸« - Coffee Recommender System
**é›¶å£¹å’–å•¡å¸«** is a full-screen interactive coffee recommendation system, built with **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **Pillow**.  
It allows users to customize their coffee based on personal taste and preferences, then browse beautiful visual recipe cards â€” just like a virtual barista.

### ðŸ§¾ Users can filter by:
- Brew time (è£½ä½œæ™‚é–“)
- Sweetness level (ç”œåº¦)
- Caffeine level (å’–å•¡å› æ¿ƒåº¦)
- Milk / Foam / Whipped cream (ç‰›å¥¶ / å¥¶æ³¡ / é®®å¥¶æ²¹)

All recipes are matched from a custom dataset and presented with full-screen visual cards designed for intuitive navigation.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features
- **Interactive GUI**: Built using Tkinter, with fullscreen visuals and stylized buttons.
- **Personalized Filtering**: Filters coffee recipes based on user-selected preferences.
- **Recipe Browsing**: Each result includes a dedicated illustrated recipe card.
- **Visual Design**: Integrates Pillow to load and resize recipe images.
- **Sound Effects**: Uses `pygame` for background music and button sound feedback.

## âœ¨ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Tkinter** (GUI framework)
- **Pillow** (Image rendering and resizing)
- **Pandas** (Data filtering and recipe logic)
- **Pygame** (Sound effects and background music)

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. **Start Screen**: Users enter a fullscreen mode and interact with a visual questionnaire.
2. **Filter Logic**: The app filters a dataset (`select.csv`) to find coffees that match the input.
3. **Recommendation List**: Displays results as stylized buttons.
4. **Recipe Display**: Each coffee opens a full image of the recipe with navigation buttons.
5. **No Match Handling**: A fallback page is shown if no match is found.

## ðŸ˜Ž My Role
I worked on simplifying and optimizing the original group project by:
- Streamlining image loading and layout using loops
- Rewriting the GUI for better structure and readability
