# â˜• é›¶å£¹å’–å•¡å¸« - Coffee Recommender System
## ðŸ§¾ Project Overview
é›¶å£¹å’–å•¡å¸« is a coffee recommender system built with Tkinter in Python.
The app offers a fullscreen, image-driven interface that helps users choose the perfect coffee based on their personal preferences, including:
- Production time 
- Sweetness
- Caffeine level
- Milk / Foam / Whipped cream

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features
- **Interactive GUI**: Built using Tkinter, with fullscreen visuals and stylized buttons.
- **Personalized Filtering**: Filters coffee recipes based on user-selected preferences.
- **Recipe Browsing**: Each result includes a dedicated illustrated recipe card.
- **Visual Design**: Integrates Pillow to load and resize recipe images.
- **Sound Effects**: Uses `pygame` for background music and button sound feedback.

## âœ¨ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Tkinter** (GUI framework)
- **Pillow** (Image rendering and resizing)
- **Pandas** (Data filtering and recipe logic)
- **Pygame** (Sound effects and background music)

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. **Start Screen**: Users enter a fullscreen mode and interact with a visual questionnaire.
2. **Filter Logic**: The app filters a dataset (`select.csv`) to find coffees that match the input.
3. **Recommendation List**: Displays results as stylized buttons.
4. **Recipe Display**: Each coffee opens a full image of the recipe with navigation buttons.
5. **No Match Handling**: A fallback page is shown if no match is found.

## ðŸ˜Ž My Role
I worked on simplifying and optimizing the original group project by:
- Streamlining image loading and layout using loops
- Rewriting the GUI for better structure and readability
